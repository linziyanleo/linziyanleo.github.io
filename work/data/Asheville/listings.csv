For fun around here I have ridden a hot air balloon over our mountains, taken a mountain top zip line tour nearby, seen our ancient mountains during a flying lesson, rented a scooter and rode the blue ridge parkway, took a few archery lessons so I could pretend to be like Katniss from The Hunger Games, which was filmed nearby.

I was born in Chateauroux, France. My sister was born in Germany and I learned to speak German when my family lived there for four years. Some of my favorites places include, Lagos de Atitlan, Uxmal, Merida, San Cristobal, Antigua, Ambergris Caye, Chichicastengo, Amsterdam, Vancouver, Cologne, Berlin and Prague. I prefer to travel off the ""gringo trail"" and have many more places to visit. Open to house trade.

I am a passionate student of compassionate communication (NVC). Two important things I've learned is that other people's behavior rarely has anything to do with me and that with patience and compassion, most all our needs can be met. 

For fun around here I have ridden a hot air balloon over our mountains, taken a mountain top zip line tour nearby, seen our ancient mountains during a flying lesson, rented a scooter and rode the blue ridge parkway, took a few archery lessons so I could pretend to be like Katniss from The Hunger Games, which was filmed nearby. I also enjoy sitting in the backyard watching my chickens do goofy things. What do you like to do for fun? Let me share more fun things to do in our beautiful mountains.

I'm somewhat of a quiet person though I do enjoy getting together with friends or taking myself out for a night on the town. When staying at someone's house, I am always conscientious of that person's life and am very respectful of everything in their home; I hope you feel the same way!

For fun around here I have ridden a hot air balloon over our mountains, taken a mountain top zip line tour nearby, seen our ancient mountains during a flying lesson, rented a scooter and rode the blue ridge parkway, took a few archery lessons so I could pretend to be like Katniss from The Hunger Games, which was filmed nearby.

This is a quiet, residential neighborhood but literally just on the edge of the River Arts District and the soon-to-open New Belgium Brewery and the greenway expansion that will come with it. Downtown and its eclectic fun is just across the bridge and up the hill (you can see downtown from the front of my house when the leaves fall). Central West Asheville - a little village unto itself- is also just down Haywood Road. The French Broad River Park and Carrier Park (both great for walking, running, biking), are just down the hill. It's also very simple to get to I-240/I-26 and I-40 from here. Biltmore Estate is 6 miles away.","The house was built in the 1920's, so while it's well loved, it is an old home. The floors are creaky, and it has some minor cosmetic issues that I am working to address. I am in the midst of touching up the trim, for instance. It is a work in progress but clean, bright, and very peaceful. As it borders the River Arts District, is also across the river and up the hill from the train yard. Noise is minimal, though you may hear cars being moved.","There is ample off-street parking on-site, and driving to anywhere in the city is a breeze from here. Parking downtown is fairly inexpensive at city lots. A cab to/from downtown shouldn't cost more than 6- 8 dollars. The bus line is nearby, but if you're a walker/biker who isn't intimidated by hills, you can easily access the River Arts District, downtown, and West Asheville (less hills to walk in W.

I moved to the Asheville area in the summer of 2013 to be near family. I love this lively mountain town full of wonderful art, music, food, beverages, and people. 

While Maryland and West Virginia are my home states, New Mexico, Maine, and Oregon are others where I've been fortunate to live. I have also lived in England and traveled through out Europe. 

I work in administration at a renewable energy company, though my background runs the gamut from social service, healing arts, grassroots fundraising, to sales/management. My degree is in cultural anthropology and sociology; I can find something in common with just about anyone.

When not at work, I enjoy exploring trails in the area, trying new restaurants, reading, running, spending time with friends and family, gardening, practicing yoga, and doing genealogy research. 

My home reflects my love of vibrant colors, affinity for the natural world, appreciation of pretty little antiques, and my peaceful, tidy aesthetic. I am kind, sincere, and playful. I love meeting and hosting new people and take pride in providing a clean, peaceful, comfortable place to relax while traveling.

Hosting style:  Chances are I will not be here to greet you.  I work a professional full time job, that requires my 100% attention while I am there, and I am a mom when I am not at work, so I may not be able to answer your questions as soon as you'd like.  Please try to get all your questions answered prior to your trip, so that I may take the time they deserve to answer them.  Also, please refer to the ""Guidebook"" I have set up on Airbnb to let you know my favorite haunts, and must visits of Asheville.  

I am an early to bed early to rise person, so I won't answer texts after 9pm or before 7am.  Sorry, but I have found I need to draw the line ;)  

The neighborhood is a family neighborhood (kids next door) so please no loud interacting, no lude behavior, and no partys.  Reminder that no more than the registered guests are allowed to be on the property, unless with prior permission.  Monday-Friday its work and school week as usual, so no late nights outside that would disrupt the neighborhood.  Weekends are a bit more slack but still please no loud interacting outside that would disrupt anyone's pleasure, or sleep.

The 3 units on the property are either rented via Airbnb or to longer term tenants, so they will probably not be of assistance in answering any questions, and it would be important to not infringe on their privacy or their enjoyment of their vacations or visits.  Please keep to yourself and act with mature behavior.  

Otherwise, I am super excited to host you, and have you here at my house.  The garden I planted my self, and so I hope you have a chance to enjoy it.  I am very proud of my little shady spot.  It's a great safe place to relax and be close to town, too.

Hosting style:  Chances are I will not be here to greet you.  I work a professional full time job, that requires my 100% attention while I am there, and I am a mom when I am not at work, so I may not be able to answer your questions as soon as you'd like.  Please try to get all your questions answered prior to your trip, so that I may take the time they deserve to answer them.  Also, please refer to the ""Guidebook"" I have set up on Airbnb to let you know my favorite haunts, and must visits of Asheville.  

I am an early to bed early to rise person, so I won't answer texts after 9pm or before 7am.  Sorry, but I have found I need to draw the line ;)  

The neighborhood is a family neighborhood (kids next door) so please no loud interacting, no lude behavior, and no partys.  Reminder that no more than the registered guests are allowed to be on the property, unless with prior permission.  Monday-Friday its work and school week as usual, so no late nights outside that would disrupt the neighborhood.  Weekends are a bit more slack but still please no loud interacting outside that would disrupt anyone's pleasure, or sleep.

The 3 units on the property are either rented via Airbnb or to longer term tenants, so they will probably not be of assistance in answering any questions, and it would be important to not infringe on their privacy or their enjoyment of their vacations or visits.  Please keep to yourself and act with mature behavior.  

Otherwise, I am super excited to host you, and have you here at my house.  The garden I planted my self, and so I hope you have a chance to enjoy it.  I am very proud of my little shady spot.  It's a great safe place to relax and be close to town, too.

I was a Marketing Executive for Digital Equipment and, later, HP. My main interest in Asheville has been the Carolina Mountain Club - which is a rather vigorous hiking group - and one of the oldest clubs in the country. We maintain sections of the AT and the Mountains To Sea Trail, as well as lead hikes across Western North Carolina. I'm also a volunteer with Asheville Humane Society and an animal lover. Another big interest is gardening. And, to a small degree, home decor and home maintenance.

I'm friendly and cheerful and like to ""go the extra mile"".
 
In my 20-month career as an Airbnb host, I've driven people to interesting  neighborhoods to give them a morning 90- minute tour and an overview of what kinds of houses and apartments are available. Or, I've driven my guests around just to just give them ""the lay of the land"" so they can explore what they like later in the day.  I've enjoyed keeping their dogs happy here at my house and fenced-in yard, while they attended an event. I've provided guests with information on fun things to do in Asheville - like hiking information, things to do downtown and in West Asheville, including the fun La Zoom bus tour of Asheville. I've driven guests to the top of a trail head along the Mountains To Sea Trail so they could leave their car at the other end for a good one-way hike. I've also printed them maps and made a detailed printed plan for visiting the Blue Ridge Parkway and its Visitor's Center and Folk Art center and helped them select the right hike for their time constraints and ability level. 

So, whether you are job hunting, house hunting, or here for fun and adventure, I can help you make the most of your visit.  BTW, I've done a lot of international and domestic travel - sometimes staying at hotels for weeks at a time. Some were good but many were rather creepy - especially their rugs and bedspreads. Your room here has hardwood floors and every piece of bed linen, including liners and mattress pad is washed before every visit.  Do I have a life motto? Hmmm. I guess it's Never Face The Facts. It has let me do a lot of ""impossible"" things.

From being a fast-paced-burned-out-exec I have turned into a part-time chinese health clinic manager, part-time horse drawn carriage tour guide, and student. All these activities keep me on-the-go, so we may or may not meet when I'm hosting unless the stars align! When we do, I am super-happy to chat over a cuppa, make recommendations, and learn more about the awesome guests who come through my home. Always feel welcome to text, even if we don't connect face-to-face :)

I love travel, meeting new people, and discovering new experiences!  I lived in Paris for a year in my early adulthood, have lived in many states and moved more than 30 times as an adult - as a former vagabond, I love hearing about your experiences.

When hosting, I want to be sure you're as comfortable (or even more so!) as you would have been at home. I keep the house as clean as possible for everyone's mutual comfort, and the shared bath is cleaned daily to be sure it's fresh when you're getting ready for your plans in town.

I love working out, camping, backpacking, yoga, and creek walking.  I love kids, am a sun worshipper, and tree-hugger. 

I have traveled all over the States as well as Europe, Scandinavia, and some Mediterranean.   I travel light.  I was raised in a loving travel-thirsty family.

Hosting style:  Chances are I will not be here to greet you.  I work a professional full time job, that requires my 100% attention while I am there, and I am a mom when I am not at work, so I may not be able to answer your questions as soon as you'd like.  Please try to get all your questions answered prior to your trip, so that I may take the time they deserve to answer them.  Also, please refer to the ""Guidebook"" I have set up on Airbnb to let you know my favorite haunts, and must visits of Asheville.  

I am an early to bed early to rise person, so I won't answer texts after 9pm or before 7am.  Sorry, but I have found I need to draw the line ;)  

The neighborhood is a family neighborhood (kids next door) so please no loud interacting, no lude behavior, and no partys.  Reminder that no more than the registered guests are allowed to be on the property, unless with prior permission.  Monday-Friday its work and school week as usual, so no late nights outside that would disrupt the neighborhood.  Weekends are a bit more slack but still please no loud interacting outside that would disrupt anyone's pleasure, or sleep.

The 3 units on the property are either rented via Airbnb or to longer term tenants, so they will probably not be of assistance in answering any questions, and it would be important to not infringe on their privacy or their enjoyment of their vacations or visits.  Please keep to yourself and act with mature behavior.  

Otherwise, I am super excited to host you, and have you here at my house.  The garden I planted my self, and so I hope you have a chance to enjoy it.  I am very proud of my little shady spot.  It's a great safe place to relax and be close to town, too.

Safe travels!

I love working out, camping, backpacking, yoga, and creek walking.  I love kids, am a sun worshipper, and tree-hugger. 

I have traveled all over the States as well as Europe, Scandinavia, and some Mediterranean.   I travel light.  I was raised in a loving travel-thirsty family.

Hosting style:  Chances are I will not be here to greet you.  I work a professional full time job, that requires my 100% attention while I am there, and I am a mom when I am not at work, so I may not be able to answer your questions as soon as you'd like.  Please try to get all your questions answered prior to your trip, so that I may take the time they deserve to answer them.  Also, please refer to the ""Guidebook"" I have set up on Airbnb to let you know my favorite haunts, and must visits of Asheville.  

I am an early to bed early to rise person, so I won't answer texts after 9pm or before 7am.  Sorry, but I have found I need to draw the line ;)  

The neighborhood is a family neighborhood (kids next door) so please no loud interacting, no lude behavior, and no partys.  Reminder that no more than the registered guests are allowed to be on the property, unless with prior permission.  Monday-Friday its work and school week as usual, so no late nights outside that would disrupt the neighborhood.  Weekends are a bit more slack but still please no loud interacting outside that would disrupt anyone's pleasure, or sleep.

The 3 units on the property are either rented via Airbnb or to longer term tenants, so they will probably not be of assistance in answering any questions, and it would be important to not infringe on their privacy or their enjoyment of their vacations or visits.  Please keep to yourself and act with mature behavior.  

Otherwise, I am super excited to host you, and have you here at my house.  The garden I planted my self, and so I hope you have a chance to enjoy it.  I am very proud of my little shady spot.  It's a great safe place to relax and be close to town, too.

Safe travels!

Both of us work full time - I'm a dental hygienist, and Tom, an IT Specialist.  We enjoy every minute we get to spend at home, and also love being with our kids and grand kids, our 2 dogs, going to dinner and movies, being out on the pontoon boat at Lake Fontana in the summer, working around the house, or just relaxing (our favorite)!  We recently bought 2 double floats and did some lazy tubing on the French Broad!  We enjoyed it so much, we'll probably be ""floating"" every chance we get!  It was beautiful and so relaxing!

Extend your mileage and walk down to the River Arts District (5 minute walk) or downtown (25 minute walk) to enjoy a multitude of restaurants, free street performance art, art galleries, and theaters.  Hop in the car and drive to the Biltmore (5 minute drive) or out for a hike in the Blue Ridge Mountains (25 minute drive).","","All you need is within walking distance.

We enjoy happy living, eating at local restaurants (of which there are so very many), designing and finishing home projects, tending our garden, keeping our chickens fed, working for two local businesses, and taking walks in our neighborhood.   After I had already decided to move to Asheville (en route from working as a tour guide in Skagway, AK and Boston, MA), Russ and I met on a cruise ship (oddly enough because this ain't our style at all) and the rest is history.  Since then, we have traveled to Spain, Alaska (again), Costa Rica, and the West Coast of the US.  We designed our home making it uniquely ours and Russ built it with the green building company where he has worked for over 8 years.

Sure found it! I love this town and its quirky people. Bought my first house almost two years ago, and working hard in my downtime to fix it up - it's a passion-project, I love being crafty and learning how houses work! The guest rooms were first on the list, and you'll occasionally see a work-in-progress as you visit. Don't worry, I keep the dust to a minimum when guests are in the house!

From being a fast-paced-burned-out-exec I have turned into a part-time chinese health clinic manager, part-time horse drawn carriage tour guide, and student. All these activities keep me on-the-go, so we may or may not meet when I'm hosting unless the stars align! When we do, I am super-happy to chat over a cuppa, make recommendations, and learn more about the awesome guests who come through my home. Always feel welcome to text, even if we don't connect face-to-face :)

I love travel, meeting new people, and discovering new experiences!  I lived in Paris for a year in my early adulthood, have lived in many states and moved more than 30 times as an adult - as a former vagabond, I love hearing about your experiences.

When hosting, I want to be sure you're as comfortable (or even more so!) as you would have been at home. I keep the house as clean as possible for everyone's mutual comfort, and the shared bath is cleaned daily to be sure it's fresh when you're getting ready for your plans in town.

It gives me great joy to create environments that invite people to relax. Originally from New Orleans, I also love good jazz and a bowl of gumbo. Asheville has won my heart though and I enjoy exploring the many hiking trails in the area. The people here are some of the happiest you will meet anywhere. I love traveling and meeting others who value the experience of exploring different places on this amazing planet. I think Airbnb is an amazing network of fellow travelers.

  I have toured all over the country and often stayed with hosts, so I know what it's like to be a guest in someone's home.

There are also wonderful croissant breakfast sandwiches and excellent coffee choices. Filo has recently renovated and expanded their offerings to include dinner and bar services. Next door, at the East Village Grill, Maria's brother Nick presents classic Greek diner fare. Between them, they give the neighborhood a kiss of Greek gustatory flare.

 I love the peace and quietude of nature walks, yoga, and gardening, and yet am very social, enjoy gathering with friends and family to share a meal, and getting to know new people.

I love to travel and experience new cultures, their language, food, habits, clothing.  I have traveled widely: all over southern Africa, the Middle East, and India.  I have lived in Switzerland, England, Greece, New Zealand, and South Africa.  I have also visited all European countries except the Scandinavian countries.  My style of traveling is enjoying the truly authentic vibe of any country by simply becoming immersed in the culture, experiencing the little known, and even the unknown.  I am open to simple accommodations as long as they are clean and hospitable.

My motto is: ""We are all One, what we do to others, we do to ourselves...thus, spread Love, Peace, Joy wherever you go...and the world will be a better place!""

My son and I moved here in 2013 from northern Italy, close to the Swiss border. Originally from the Caribbean I have lived on three continents and speak 3 languages. 
I'm interested in hosting easy going pleasant people I can feel happy about having in my home around me and when they leave I want to feel that I can't wait until they come again for another visit.  You can cook, do laundry if you need to and I have wireless.  I will try to help you as best as I can but I am pretty busy so I need guests who are self-sufficient and because I'm a terrible tourist myself (I've been to Paris three times and the closest I got to the Eiffel Tour was on a city tour bus and I'm perfectly fine with that) I'm not good for statistics on population, income, politics or suggestions on places to go unforturnately.  But on the plus side for the most part I'm happy, easygoing, bright enough to live 51 years well and have a great sense of humour.  I live on trying to be as considerate as possible to others and I truly appreciate when that is also shown to me.  If you are difficult, or a complainer and you know you are because people have told you in as many different ways as they could, my home is not the one for you. You won't have a good time and neither will I. 
I do have a dog and a cat so if you have allergies this is likely not the house for you unfortunately. Gracie, our dog, is very friendly and very loving. If you stroke her she will be your slave.  :) After 8 years I'm still not sure Diego, the cat, even likes me. :)
Any other information you may need, please ask and I will be honest in my reply. :)

We restored a wonderful old house in the Chestnut Hills Historic district where we accomplished our dream of having a bed and breakfast.  We lived and worked there until (PHONE NUMBER HIDDEN) Arlington Street is only a few blocks from the bed and breakfast that we started.  Now I live alone in another ""one of a kind"" house.  Much of my time is spent mentoring young men in my church and facilitating a grief recovery program.

We chose Asheville because the mountains offer a sense of peace and tranquility not found in many other places.  Also, we were attracted here because of the fascinating mix of people who call Asheville home.  Asheville has wonderful restaurants comparable to many of our favorites in Houston.   Also to be found in Asheville are the Symphony, Asheville Community Theater, and outstanding medical facilities.  We were drawn here by the Blue Ridge Parkway, The Biltmore Estate, The Folk Art Center and the like.

We moved to Asheville 3 years ago from Clearwater, Florida, where we lived for 24 years. Prior to that we lived 5 years in the San Francisco Bay area. Both of us are originally from the metro Detroit area. We have always enjoyed traveling as well as historical books and movies. Lately back issues have curtailed our out of country travel, however we know the benefits of a comfortable mattress, back friendly chairs and sofas and good televisions and outfit our home and apartment accordingly!  My hobbies are gardening and jewelry making.  Our home and apartment sit on 2 acres of mainly hillside. When we moved here the land was in need of someone who loved to nurture the vegetation and enrich the soil so I literally ""dug in"" and began the process. If it's in spring, summer or fall you will see me outside with garden tool in hand. Marshall enjoys biking, driving his car along the Blue Ridge, and keeping up with football, baseball, hockey and auto racing. 
Our son Eric works in the film industry as a grip. He and his family recently relocated to Atlanta, Georgia as the film industry in North Carolina lost it's tax incentive and Georgia added an incentive. We miss them all but especially our beautiful grandchild Kiela, who is 3. We were able to have them close for the past 3 years and enjoyed that tremendously!
While neither of us are great cooks we do love all the simple natural foods that Asheville has so much of. We can't do without Amish butter, organic peanut butter, Ezekiel toast plus good tea and coffee in the morning! Trader Joe or Fresh Market can help us most days with semi prepared foods so we don't feel that a ""restaurant run"" is mandatory!
Our apartment is located on the lower level of our home. It has it's own entrance, plus 2 parking sites. Exterior is brick. We did a build out of this area, which is roughly 1100 square foot over the past 2 years, adding walls, electric, plumbing, new windows, and of course all the things that make a place fun to stay in, like fresh carpet and paint, new cabinets, appliances, lighting, etc. It has been decorated and furnished with various antiques as well as new pieces. We love mission style so that is seen both in our home as well as in the apartment. If I travel I always want to know about the mattress so we furnished our apartment with a Tempur-pedic  king bed and a good quality queen standard mattress. We put a Ekornes Stressless chair in the living room as well as a sofa with spring down cushions. The electric fireplace adds ambiance as well as offers additional heat if needed, although we have a heat pump.

For fifteen years we have enjoyed hosting visitors in our Asheville, North Carolina cottage from across the country and around the world including England and Ireland, Greece, Canada, Mexico and Cuba, Argentina, Japan and The Phillipines. We welcome guests from around the corner, across the US and our international visitors as well! Our college-age daughter grew up listening to many different languages in the driveway.

We enjoy traveling including work-and-play trips to Ireland, England, Sweden and Greece. Twenty years here at our residence built in 1926 and our adjacent Terrace Cottage was built in 2000.

We love working in our perennial beds and veggie gardens.

I'm an online entrepreneur designing and marketing wooden playthings for young people. I also collect and blog about vintage wooden toys.

My wife is a clinician with UNC-Chapel Hill School of Medicine. 

We love living in Asheville and are always happy to return home when away. It is a nationally-celebrated and uniquely beautiful mountain city overflowing with eclectic opportunities for enjoying first-rate dining, entertainment, crafts and artwork. The Blue Ridge Parkway entrance is ten minutes from our home, leading to the North Carolina Arboretum, Mount Pisgah, Craggy Gardens, and Mount Mitchell- the highest elevation east of the Rocky Mountains. 

I fly fish and welcome inquiries regarding our local waters. My favorite streams are under an hour away and have been rated in Trout Unlimited's Top 100. There are excellent fly shops and outfitters nearby if you need them.

Walking, running and cycling are huge in Asheville and there are too many options to mention from neighborhood greenways and hill climbs to maniacal day-longs as well, contact us for info. Our local runner's and cyclist's shops are just blocks away.

Speaking of walkable- ditto our supermarket and specialty/whole foods markets, cafes, coffee shops, local theater, pharmacies, UNC-Asheville, botanical gardens, awesome kid's parks and more.

Thanks for looking at Terrace Cottage and we welcome your inquiries!

He is always helping a neighbor or a friend (sometimes people he does not even know) with projects around their homes.  I sell residential real estate and farms and land.  Land is what I really enjoy the most!  What better job could you have than one where you get to go outdoors, hike property and find just the right fit for the right folks.  

Steve and I love to travel - usually to a beach or to visit friends and our children and lovely grandchildren.  When we are not working, we are on the Harley taking small rides in these beautiful Appalachian Mountains.  

Abner's Cabin has been a vacation rental since 2006 and we have many return travelers.  We have met some awesome people of whom many have become friends over the years.  We truly care about your comfort and want to make sure you are lacking in nothing when you arrive.

As a guest, I'm typically traveling for short business trips. I help clients with  technology strategy, process and organizational problems. I'm an easy guest as I'm typically at client sites during the day and happy with internet access and a quiet room for the night.

Even after 24 years living here is still new, fresh and exciting to us. We spend time exploring new restaurants, galleries and shops and making new friends and enjoying the old. Our motto is ""Don't postpone joy.""

I am a former New Yorker and Floridian who ended up in Asheville.  We picked this place for its very close vicinity to downtown.  This place is fairly new (built in 2007) and has location, location, location.   We are a stones throw from the Biltmore Estate, Orange Peel and Catawba Brewery where most of the tours like Ghost Tour Trolley (Grey Line) depart.  We are also next to McDonald's, Wendy's, Long John Silver's, The Bohemian, T.G.I.Friday's, The shops in Biltmore Village, all within walking distance.  I went to school for cooking, so there may be a New York Cheesecake, Key Lime Pie, Hummingbird cake, Berry tart, or scones awaiting you.  I love downtown and am offering free rides into and out of the city which saves you about $9.- 12. per trip.  Most of the cool tours like La Zoom take off across from the Orange Peel which is about a mile and a quarter from my location.
I will pick up from the Asheville Airport, too, which is about 25 minutes from the house.  No transport from Greenville or Charlotte.   
Asheville is the coolest place offering HungerGames Tours, Zip lines, a new Bikebar that was seen on Las Vegas 'Trip Flip' and is nothing short of hilarious, downtown walking ghost tours, a Ghost Tour trolley, The Biltmore Estate, Grove Park, Wicked Weed, and so many places to eat, not to mention go out and explore.
I look forward to meeting you and you can consider me your 'concierge and chauffer' for your holiday to Asheville. This is one trip that will make you consider moving here.   I flew down from New York to see Rent, and moved here shortly after.  I am a true Sagittarian and enjoy meeting fellow wanderers...lol...See you soon..",within a few hours,100%,100%,t,https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/3270fa11-b5d6-4547-afe4-7a83d2ff0490.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/3270fa11-b5d6-4547-afe4-7a83d2ff0490.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,,1,1,"['email', 'phone', 'reviews']",t,f,"Iris Street, Asheville, NC 28803, United States",,28803,Asheville,NC,28803,North Carolina Mountains,"Asheville, NC",US,United States,35.559811261161066,-82.5356265735873,t,Bed & Breakfast,Private room,2,1.0,1,1,Real Bed,"{Internet,""Wireless Internet"",""Air Conditioning"",""Free Parking on Premises"",""Pets Allowed"",Breakfast,Heating,""Family/Kid Friendly"",""Suitable for Events"",Washer,Dryer,""Smoke Detector"",""Carbon Monoxide Detector"",""First Aid Kit"",""Fire Extinguisher"",Shampoo,""Lock on Bedroom Door"",""24-Hour Check-in"",Hangers,Iron,""Laptop Friendly Workspace""}",,$49.00,,,,$10.00,2,$0.00,1,1125,today,,29,54,84,359,2016-04-21,58,2013-09-30,2016-04-17,94,9,9,10,10,9,9,f,,"NORTH CAROLINA, NORTH CAROLINA, BUNCOMBE",f,strict,f,f,021,Buncombe,37,,1.86

We became AirBnB hosts in 2014 and have since hosted nearly 400 bookings/guests.

We live in Asheville in the beautiful mountains of western North Carolina.

Allison works as a fourth grade teacher at Mills River Elementary School. Peter works as the Trails & Outreach Coordinator at a regional land trust, Carolina Mountain Land Conservancy. Both of us work to keep this region we love as wonderful as it is today, and make it even better for future generations.

We love to take road trips throughout the year. We have appreciated the kindness of many over the years who have let us stay in their home or camp in their yard, or have rented a room to us for a reasonable rate. We are guests who are focused on our travels and we most often are seeking simply a room to hang our hat for the night before our travels resume the following morning. For that reason, most hosts barely know that we are there. In appreciation for the kindness shown to us over the years, we pay it forward by being clean and courteous when we are guests in the homes of others, and we are seeking to host guests who are similarly self-sufficient and simply seeking a basic place for the night.

My husband and I are looking forward to hosting guests in our home as well as being a guest of others during our travels. We became AirBnB hosts in 2014 and have since hosted nearly 400 bookings/guests.

We live in Asheville in the beautiful mountains of western North Carolina.

Allison works as a fourth grade teacher at Mills River Elementary School. Peter works as the Trails & Outreach Coordinator at a regional land trust, Carolina Mountain Land Conservancy. Both of us work to keep this region we love as wonderful as it is today, and make it even better for future generations.

We love to take road trips throughout the year. We have appreciated the kindness of many over the years who have let us stay in their home or camp in their yard, or have rented a room to us for a reasonable rate. We are guests who are focused on our travels and we most often are seeking simply a room to hang our hat for the night before our travels resume the following morning. For that reason, most hosts barely know that we are there. In appreciation for the kindness shown to us over the years, we pay it forward by being clean and courteous when we are guests in the homes of others, and we are seeking to host guests who are similarly self-sufficient and simply seeking a basic place for the night.

I enjoy community, domestic life, dancing, vintage stuff, textiles, mountains, rivers, gardens, cats, other people's dogs, adventure, the Caribbean, cooking, eating, games, funky art, funky artists, yard sales, growers' markets, fireflies.
I think about how things work, how systems interconnect, cause and effect. I have million dollar ideas and don't develop them.
I like to have a purpose or a project, can't go somewhere new just to be a tourist. During leisure time I like to read a good book, play Bananagrams or watch something off-beat.

I grew up in mid-Michigan and decided to flee the nest when I was 18 and have been living in Asheville ever since (about 5 years). I love my town almost as much as I love to travel. I spent time backpacking SE Asia in the spring of 2013 and realized the contribution that fellow travelers and those you meet along the way really make to your journey.  I'm in nursing school through Western Carolina University and hope to move West upon graduation. Sometimes my mutt, Lotus, travels with me but sometimes he stays with my friends. Following nursing, my dog, my people, and traveling... is music. Of course it's music. It may not be in that order either but I live for music as long as there isn't too much of a twang involved. And food. Wonderful, weird food. 

I always leave a room cleaner than when I arrived. I even make my bed every morning. My remotes even have a certain arrangement that they must sit in.

It takes about 20 minutes to walk downtown, and about 10 minutes to get to South slope or RAD.  These are mountains so the walk is hilly and may take longer for less fit people.  Uber is a great option, we usually only pay about $6 to go anywhere downtown or to take an Uber home.  South Slope = Beer!

I also enjoy sitting in the backyard watching my chickens do goofy things. What do you like to do for fun? Let me share more fun things to do in our beautiful mountains.

I am a passionate student of compassionate communication (NVC). Two important things I've learned is that other people's behavior rarely has anything to do with me and that with patience and compassion, most all our needs can be met. 

For fun around here I have ridden a hot air balloon over our mountains, taken a mountain top zip line tour nearby, seen our ancient mountains during a flying lesson, rented a scooter and rode the blue ridge parkway, took a few archery lessons so I could pretend to be like Katniss from The Hunger Games, which was filmed nearby.

I was born in N.J, although you would never guess (No Jersey accent here!).   I moved with my family to Clearwater, Florida when I was in high school and graduated from the University of South Florida in Tampa with a degree in Psychology. I eventually heard about Asheville, NC, visited, moved there and lived there full time for 15 years. For the last 6 years I have been splitting my time between Dunedin,(just north of Clearwater) Florida and Asheville, NC, two delightfully beautiful, creative and diverse cities, I absolutely adore. 

 I love the beaches of Florida, but my heart is always drawn back to the mountains.

 When I first moved to North Carolina, I was a social worker. Through some friends, I was drawn into a seasonal inn- keeping position at a ski lodge in Beech Mtn, North Carolina. That lead me to work for a couple of years at the Richmond Hill Inn in Asheville as a concierge.

Ultimately, I decided I wanted to have my own vacation rentals.

That dream has finally materialized and I have furnished vacation rentals in Asheville and Dunedin, where I divide my time. I enjoy traveling, meeting people and providing the most comfortable and  friendly lodging that I can.

My attraction to Asheville & Dunedin besides the natural surroundings are the great outdoor recreation opportunities- biking, hiking, whitewater rafting, motorcycle rides on the Blue Ridge Parkway, kayaking, tennis and lounging at the beach.  I also love the warm, intelligent, creative people of both Asheville & Dunedin, the abundant live music, the vibrant arts scene, many incredible restaurants, and its celebration of diversity.

SO WELCOME TO ASHEVILLE & DUNEDIN!

When I travel, I prefer to stay in individually owned places like cottages, B&B's, hostels, condos and apartments instead of generic hotels. And I want my guests to experience the incredible vibes of Asheville & Dunedin, to enjoy a quiet, comforting, unique get a way, and then come back often to visit.

 The welcome mat is always out ! Either myself or a friend is always available, should the need arise during your stay.

 There is a lock box  for your convenience, so no worries about conflicting schedules, late arrivals, etc. 

 I can be contacted via phone, text or email, before, during and after your stay.

My life motto;

“Security is mostly a superstition. It does not exist in nature, nor do the children of humans as a whole experience it. Avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure. Life is either a daring adventure or nothing."" Helen Keller

Here's to your life adventures!

Cheers,
Julie

I was so happy to find this one. I can't say enough good about this neighborhood. It is the best for walking around and walking to downtown and back. My favorite place to walk here is Riverside Cemetery, and it is really a must see, not just for its famous graves (like Thomas Wolfe & family), but also for its magnificent trees and rolling hills. Montford is truly beautiful, with so many Victorian homes. If you get a chance, do walk or drive down Montford Avenue and Cumberland Avenue and look at all the gorgeous homes. I think walking is better, especially on a spring or summer day, because it really gives you a chance to take in the splendor that is historic Asheville.

Airbnb wants me to tell you 5 things I can't live without. Here are more than 5 for now:  Love and  human interaction, good conversation, and travel. I love hearing other people's stories. I love learning and doing new things. I love having good projects and challenges. I like to share my gifts in a way that makes the world a better place. Most of all, I am very committed to my soul path, and I strive to listen to the voice of Spirit in everything I do. 

I like to broaden my perspective, quiet my mind, move my body, cherish moments, pet animals, eat good food, feel swept away by how wonderful life can feel, and allow myself to grieve when the time comes for that. 

As far as my style of traveling goes, I like so many kinds. I love camping, traveling solo, traveling on the fly and for little money, and I like my comforts. I've come to find that I love luxury too. 

As far as hosting goes, I truly feel that if I've done my job right, you will have all of your needs met, and you will not need too much from me.

I really want you to come to Asheville. I think it is a wonderful place. But don't take my word for it. Come see for yourself.

I was born in N.J, although you would never guess (No Jersey accent here!).   I moved with my family to Clearwater, Florida when I was in high school and graduated from the University of South Florida in Tampa with a degree in Psychology. I eventually heard about Asheville, NC, visited, moved there and lived there full time for 15 years. For the last 6 years I have been splitting my time between Dunedin,(just north of Clearwater) Florida and Asheville, NC, two delightfully beautiful, creative and diverse cities, I absolutely adore. 

 I love the beaches of Florida, but my heart is always drawn back to the mountains.

 When I first moved to North Carolina, I was a social worker. Through some friends, I was drawn into a seasonal inn- keeping position at a ski lodge in Beech Mtn, North Carolina. That lead me to work for a couple of years at the Richmond Hill Inn in Asheville as a concierge.

Ultimately, I decided I wanted to have my own vacation rentals.

That dream has finally materialized and I have furnished vacation rentals in Asheville and Dunedin, where I divide my time. I enjoy traveling, meeting people and providing the most comfortable and  friendly lodging that I can.

My attraction to Asheville & Dunedin besides the natural surroundings are the great outdoor recreation opportunities- biking, hiking, whitewater rafting, motorcycle rides on the Blue Ridge Parkway, kayaking, tennis and lounging at the beach.  I also love the warm, intelligent, creative people of both Asheville & Dunedin, the abundant live music, the vibrant arts scene, many incredible restaurants, and its celebration of diversity.

SO WELCOME TO ASHEVILLE & DUNEDIN!

When I travel, I prefer to stay in individually owned places like cottages, B&B's, hostels, condos and apartments instead of generic hotels. And I want my guests to experience the incredible vibes of Asheville & Dunedin, to enjoy a quiet, comforting, unique get a way, and then come back often to visit.

 The welcome mat is always out ! Either myself or a friend is always available, should the need arise during your stay.

 There is a lock box  for your convenience, so no worries about conflicting schedules, late arrivals, etc. 

 I can be contacted via phone, text or email, before, during and after your stay.

My life motto;

“Security is mostly a superstition. It does not exist in nature, nor do the children of humans as a whole experience it. Avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure. Life is either a daring adventure or nothing."" Helen Keller

Here's to your life adventures!

Cheers,
Julie

We love living in the middle of Asheville where we can walk or ride our bikes to everything. I run my own business, Coffee Crate ((URL HIDDEN) from my home office and Eric has a law practice where he enjoys working with individuals and small businesses. We are also landlords of 14 apartments in Asheville and 1 AirBNB. But what we love most is spending time as family with our 4 year old daughter, Penelope, and little Hugo, 16 months. Family hikes, enjoying Asheville's culinary scene, and people watching at some of Asheville's many festivals are some of our favorite things to do as a family. Yes, we love Asheville, but one of our favorite places on Earth is NYC! Eric also loves Japan and I love anywhere Europe. Eric is into cycling and nerd stuff and I am into art, herbs, and social justice.

I was born in N.J, although you would never guess (No Jersey accent here!).   I moved with my family to Clearwater, Florida when I was in high school and graduated from the University of South Florida in Tampa with a degree in Psychology. I eventually heard about Asheville, NC, visited, moved there and lived there full time for 15 years. For the last 6 years I have been splitting my time between Dunedin,(just north of Clearwater) Florida and Asheville, NC, two delightfully beautiful, creative and diverse cities, I absolutely adore. 

 I love the beaches of Florida, but my heart is always drawn back to the mountains.

 When I first moved to North Carolina, I was a social worker. Through some friends, I was drawn into a seasonal inn- keeping position at a ski lodge in Beech Mtn, North Carolina. That lead me to work for a couple of years at the Richmond Hill Inn in Asheville as a concierge.

Ultimately, I decided I wanted to have my own vacation rentals.

That dream has finally materialized and I have furnished vacation rentals in Asheville and Dunedin, where I divide my time. I enjoy traveling, meeting people and providing the most comfortable and  friendly lodging that I can.

My attraction to Asheville & Dunedin besides the natural surroundings are the great outdoor recreation opportunities- biking, hiking, whitewater rafting, motorcycle rides on the Blue Ridge Parkway, kayaking, tennis and lounging at the beach.  I also love the warm, intelligent, creative people of both Asheville & Dunedin, the abundant live music, the vibrant arts scene, many incredible restaurants, and its celebration of diversity.

SO WELCOME TO ASHEVILLE & DUNEDIN!

When I travel, I prefer to stay in individually owned places like cottages, B&B's, hostels, condos and apartments instead of generic hotels. And I want my guests to experience the incredible vibes of Asheville & Dunedin, to enjoy a quiet, comforting, unique get a way, and then come back often to visit.

 The welcome mat is always out ! Either myself or a friend is always available, should the need arise during your stay.

 There is a lock box  for your convenience, so no worries about conflicting schedules, late arrivals, etc. 

 I can be contacted via phone, text or email, before, during and after your stay.

My life motto;

“Security is mostly a superstition. It does not exist in nature, nor do the children of humans as a whole experience it. Avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure. Life is either a daring adventure or nothing."" Helen Keller

Here's to your life adventures!

Cheers,
Julie

I have been in Asheville for over a decade and am chock-full of info for great local-owned eateries like Early Girl, adventures indoor like the Orange Peel and outdoors like tubing down the French Broad.  I am highly engaged in the community through committees and boards, and almost always can refer you to the event of the week.  I love Asheville and do not intend to leave any time soon, yet traveling to nature's best backpacking is a passion of mine.

I am excited for the opportunity to share my brand new home with others.  Not only is this the first house I've owned, but I built it, as well.  I get so much joy out of creating this peaceful, warm environment.  My favorite morning ritual is to walk around the yard, take in the plants and sip coffee on the spacious porch.  Come try it for yourself!

Grew up in San Francisco.  My parents immigrated from Ireland,  so I have lots of Irish family and travel there frequently.  One of my favorite things about Asheville is how similar it is to Ireland. Just as green, but with better weather.  

I am an Electrical Engineer, worked at NASA;  jumped ship to teach high school science at Gunn High School in Palo Alto. 

I enjoy entertaining and traveling and love the idea of creating a space where visitors to Asheville can relax and enjoy this amazing town.  I lived in the Montford home for five years, and it is a wonderful space, with great energy.   I spent many hours working in the garden and this spring it's paying off........Then I moved to another lovely neighborhood, Grove Park, and renovated another 100 year old home.  I also rent the apartment downstairs in that home.

I have an office in my home so I'm here a LOT. I am also crazy about gardening. 

I am gradually converting pretty much all of my lawn to gardens. I grow rare and wonderful trees and shrubs, many kinds of annual and perennial flowering plants, and all kinds of veggies. I am currently planting fruit trees, brambles, strawberries, etc. Not much lawn left!

I love to rent rooms to interesting people! I have had so much fun meeting the folks who come here through Airbnb! They have come from many countries, states, and walks of life. I love it! I am hoping to get some Turkish visitors so that I can practice my Turkish on them. I have traveled in many countries, myself and love to swap stories!

I love good food. I grow much of my own. I am interested in all things homesteading. I have been been at this since the 1970's when I built and lived in my own underground house in Michigan. I love to share ideas on this subject.

I love to DANCE! Especially to the blues. You can find me out making something up on the dance floor at the great clubs in ""Ashevegas"". Looking silly, maybe, but having fun!

For the past 7 years, I have owned and managed two very successful short term vacation rentals where guests occupied the entire space, yet the home remained void of me as a host. Most recently, I have changed directions, opening rooms in my home to travelers like yourself to offer comfortable, well-thought out spaces with a fun, eclectic vibe and all the comforts of home.

I am a high ""D"" personality type, a doer, a get-it-done type of girl. My ""I"" falls close second, and in good company, I have a lot to say and will use large gestures to make my point. I can't live without change, chocolate, earl grey tea, music and inspiring words. I prefer to surround myself with positive, driven people or those constantly moving forward to create their best life possible! 

I am a low-key host with a limited presence and one that allows you the freedom of use for the common areas and of course, your own personal space. It is my goal to ensure that you are comfortable, making my home your own. I am confident that you will find Out on a Limb to exceed your expectations, where unlike most rentals, my experience in the business translates for you as an above average accommodation.

This is me playing with two of our grandkids who live just 1/4 mile walk away (trail).
I love to share and would like to invite you to our place at the very ""doorstep"" to the mountains.  I love putting on my running or hiking shoes or getting on my mountain bike right from the house and hitting some of  best trails in the country. This place, where the French Broad River and the Blue Ridge Mountains meet, can be the beginning of great memories for you as well--including fishing, hiking, road or mountain biking, and driving on the parkway east or west to the highest elevations east of Colorado.  There is so much to say about our beloved Asheville as well (great food, music, shopping, the Biltmore House, etc.), which is only about a 10 minute drive from our place. These mountains are full of treasures 365 days of the year and it would be my pleasure to share some of my favorite places to help your trip be a special one!

My name is Austin!  I'm an RN in Asheville, North Carolina.  Total work-a-holic, but I'm trying to start traveling more.  In my free time, I'm all about anything outside, always followed up with a few margaritas.  I love to read, Garth Stein being my favorite author, and I'm shamelessly obsessed with self help novels.  Music is pretty nonstop in my house, I listen to mostly indie/alternative stuff, but I also love reggae and jazz.  I'm all about making the most out of my life and having a great time with everything I do.  

I won't lie, I'm kind of a neat-freak, but aside from that I'm super easygoing and laid-back.  I can't wait to meet you! 

At home, I'm pretty big on recycling and repurposing, and I'm currently beginning to compost as well.  My home (me) is about 90% vegan and I have a gluten allergy.

We have a new puppy and love to travel. We both work from home and travel for work, so most of our free time is spent enjoying our home. When we get the chance to take a trip we like to see and do all that we can in a short amount of time. We are hoping Airbnb allows us to travel more and slow down a bit.

We love kayaking, walking, getting the behind the scene's look on a new place, food, food, food... window shopping, exploring, nature and a good craft beer or a big glass of red at the end of the day. We love Italy and being out West the most but the last few years we have really enjoyed hiking and exploring the mountains, lakes and rivers of WNC.

We aren't much in to hanging around, we really like to be out an about. We like learning and sharing stories but won't be looking for you to plan our trip. We are also looking to become hosts as we have a great space in our home, an incredible destination in Asheville and enjoy meeting people and learning of their experiences.
